Team 8's 301 Project: AndroidImpact
## Overview
Impacting lives. One food item at a time. AndroidImpact enables users to be on top of all their foodstuffs,
whether it's what's in the back of their pantry, what recipe to cook for the family, a plan of all the meals 
they'll eat throughout the week, or a virtual shopping list. Users are sure to never miss another expiry date,
forget another grocery item, lose a recipe, or have trouble deciding what to eat. This app is lifechanging.
